# MyNet

 **MyNet** is an application that creates a database containing information on people 
around the user and visualizes how they relate to the user.
This application is designed especially for *Entrepreneurs*, *Managers*, etc who meet 
many people in order to grow their network.
 
I've had many opportunities to interact with people from various backgrounds since I 
enrolled in the university, but I struggled with remembering their faces, names, 
major, and so on. So I decided to organize their information and visualize 
the relationship with me by using this application.

###User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add people I met
- As a user, I want to be able to add their information 
- As a user, I want to be able to view the list of people
- As a user, I want to be able to view information on them
- As a user, I want to be able to remove a person by his/her ID
- As a user, I want to be able to find a person by his/her ID
- As a user, I want to be able to visualize relationships between me and people I added
- As a user, I want to be able to filter the people by specified group (e.g age, occupation, etc..)
- As a user, I want to be able to save lists of people in MyNet to file
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load people in MyNet from file
- As a user, when I want to be notified when I input invalid value.
- As a user, when I select open the application, I want to be reminded to load file to MyNet and have the option to do so or not.
- As a user, when I select the quit option from the application menu, I want to be reminded to save MyNet to file and have the option to do so or not.
- As a user, when I start the application, I want to be given the option to load people in MyNet from file
- As a user, I want to be healed....
Phase 4: Task 2:
Test and design a class in your model package that is robust.  
You must have at least one method that throws a checked exception (When remove failed).
You must have one test for the case where the exception is expected and another where the exception is not expected.
Phase 4: Task 3:
If I had more time:
- As you see in the UML diagram, there is too much coupling in MyNetRunner and the other
classes. If I had more time to work on the project I want to reduce the coupling by implementing
 classes or interfaces that controls these classes.
